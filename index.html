     <div id="content">
       <p>The Durham House of Pets was established in 1956 and has been a local favorite for its family friendly atmosphere.  It was founded by Dan and Susan Oâ€™Malley when they decided to use their love for animals to create their own Pet Store.  When DHP first opened, they sold every live animal from dogs and cats to chickens.  Along with the live animals, the store used to sell mostly farming supplies.  A large portion of their store was dedicated to everything one would need for running their own farm with grain to feed the animals and the necessary equipment for running a successful farm.
 Times have changed since the store opened a mere 63 years ago and has shifted its focus to selling more common domestic animal products.  We have since stopped selling live animals in order to ensure these young animals are not kept living in a store until they are adopted.  With the farming industry becoming less popular, we shifted our focus to selling supplies for cats, dogs and snakes.
